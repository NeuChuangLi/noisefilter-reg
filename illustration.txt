illustration:
1. syntheticdata.m is used to generate UR, IFR, G-means and F1-score on synthetic dataset

2. GandF is used to generate G-means and F1-score on regression datasets
alter row 52: Y(randind(s))=rand; to Y(randind(s))=sqrt(0.5)*randn; then the noise type is Gaussian noise

3. URandIFR is used to generate UR and IFR on regression datasets
alter row 63: Y(randind(s))=sqrt(0.5)*randn; to Y(randind(s))=rand; then the noise type is Uniform noise

4. autoexecute helps to generate the average accuracy and statistical test
the output KNNoutput, RFoutput, BPoutput are average results, and outputcell is used as input of dealccscell
Gotten the output of dealccscell, you can use the following code to generate rank of alined friedman test

[averank] = matrixrank(RMSEmatrix)
RMSEmatrix=[1 2 3 4 5 6 7;RMSEmatrix];
xlswrite('RMSE1.xlsx',RMSEmatrix);

Then feed RMSE1.xlsx to Rstudio to conduct the aline friedman test and holm test.
You will use the library scmamp and xlsx.
Note that, dealccscell(outputcell, 1,1) give the output of KNN and 10% noise level, similarly, dealccscell(outputcell, 2,3) give the output of RF and 30% noise level
and dealccscell(outputcell, 3,5) give the output of BP under 50% noise level

If you want to change the noise type, please alter the row 20 in noisefiltercompare.m

5. wilcox.m is used to conduct wilcoxon test. Given the outputs, you can use the following code to generate the test result.

s=zeros(22,2);
for i=1:1:22
s(i,1)=KNNCELL{i,1}(1);
s(i,2)=KNNCELL{i,1}(2);
end
[p,h]=ranksum(s(:,1),s(:,2),0.1)
mean(s)

Similarly, KNNCELL{i,1} can be altered by RFCELL{i,2} or BPCELL{i,5} to get the results of RF or BP on 20% or 50% noise level.
If you want to change the noise type, please alter the row 70 in wilcox.m
